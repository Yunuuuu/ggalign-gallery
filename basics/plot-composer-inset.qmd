# Plot Composer - Inset

Sometimes it's useful to inset a plot into another.

```{r}
library(ggalign)
```

```{r}
library(grid)
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) +
    geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))
# Use viewport() to define the plot area
p1 + inset(p2, vp = viewport(0.6, 0.6,
    just = c(0, 0), width = 0.4, height = 0.4
))
```
